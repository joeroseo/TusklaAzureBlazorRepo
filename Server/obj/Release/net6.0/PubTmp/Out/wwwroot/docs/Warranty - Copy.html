        Repair or replacement of EVehicles-branded parts purchased directly from
        EVehicles, over-the-counter, online or purchased and installed by EVehicles
        Service or a EVehicles Collision Center, may be covered under the EVehicles

        perform the function(s) for which it was designed, due to defects in
        material or workmanship of the part manufactured or supplied by EVehicles,

        operating performance due to normal wear and tear.

        The EVehicles Parts, Body &amp; Paint Repair Limited Warranty begins on the
        purchase date of the part(s), and coverage extends for a period of 12

        <strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Do I have to take my vehicle to the EVehicles Service Center?
        </strong>
        <br />
        With over-the-air software updates, remote diagnostics and the support of
        our Mobile Service technicians, the need for a Service Center visit is
        reduced. If your vehicle does require service, you can schedule a service
        appointment in the EVehicles app. If you choose to take your vehicle to a
        non-EVehicles shop for maintenance or repairs, coverage under your warranty
        could be affected if any problems occur.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Does the New Vehicle Limited Warranty transfer to the new owner if I
            sell my vehicle?
        </strong>
        <br />
        Yes. Your New Vehicle Limited Warranty will follow your vehicle and be
        transferred to the new owner when a vehicle ownership transfer is performed
        through EVehicles.
