        <strong>Ordering a EVehicle</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Before ordering your EVehicle vehicle, learn more about the different
        financing, trade-in and delivery options available.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Order</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <a name="after-placing-order"></a>
        <strong>
            I just ordered my EVehicle vehicle. What are the next steps?
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        After placing your order, you can start preparing for your delivery day.
        Start by downloading the EVehicle app and use it to confirm your
        registration and delivery location. These details are required to move
        forward.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, use the EVehicle app to select whether you plan to trade-in
        your current vehicle or finance your new EVehicle vehicle. You’ll receive a
        notification when your vehicle delivery approaches to submit your trade-in
        self-inspection or complete your credit application, if applicable.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong>
        Your EVehicle Account credentials are the same e-mail and password used to
        place your order.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a name="delivery-options"></a>
        <strong>What delivery options are available?</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        We offer multiple delivery options. Once your vehicle is available, you’ll
        receive an email and an SMS to your mobile device with a link to schedule a
        delivery appointment. In some states, delivery options may be limited due
        to availability and regulatory restrictions.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a name="delivery-timing"></a>
        <strong>When can I expect to take delivery?</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Delivery timing varies by model, location and current production
        availability. For more immediate delivery, check existing inventory in your
        area.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a name="connectivity"></a>
        <strong>What connectivity package do new cars come with?</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        All cars purchased through EVehicle will receive a free Premium
        Connectivity trial. After the trial period ends, Premium Connectivity will
        be available as a subscription through the EVehicle app
    </p>
    <p>
        <a name="financing"></a>
        <strong>Financing and Leasing</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How do I apply for EVehicle Financing or Leasing?</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        If available in your state, you’ll receive a notification to submit a
        credit application in the EVehicle app as you get closer to your vehicle
        delivery. Once you submit your credit application, the credit decision will
        be available in the EVehicle app within 48 hours of submission. You will
        receive a notification once your credit decision is ready for review.
        Leasing is not available for used vehicles.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Can I finance with my own bank or credit union?</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Yes. In order to apply third-party financing to your purchase, we require:
    </p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>
            The name of the funding institution
        </li>
        <li>
            The exact dollar amount of your loan
        </li>
        <li>
            The lien-holder address and phone number
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Final paperwork and VIN will be available in the EVehicle app once
        assigned.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>When do I apply for EVehicle Financing or Leasing?</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        You will receive a notification on your mobile device letting you know when
        to apply for financing. Finance and lease approvals are valid up to 60
        days, so we advise you apply for financing or leasing once you are within
        that time frame of delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            What purchase options are available at the end of the lease?
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        All EVehicle vehicles delivered on or after April 15, 2022 are not eligible
        for purchase at the end of the lease.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a name="trade-ins"></a>
        <strong>Trade-Ins</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How does the trade-in process work?</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        To begin the trade-in process, get a quote through the EVehicle app. As you
        get closer to your vehicle delivery date, you’ll receive a notification on
        your mobile device asking you to complete a self-inspection. After you
        submit your self-inspection, you will receive an official trade-in offer if
        your vehicle qualifies. If you decide to move forward, you may be asked to
        submit more information in the EVehicle app prior to taking delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>What kind of vehicles does EVehicle accept?</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        We accept cars, trucks, vans and SUVs on trade-in towards the purchase of a
        new or used EVehicle vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How does EVehicle determine the price of my vehicle?</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        All EVehicle trade values are generated out of a standard calculation based
        on vehicle configuration, history, mileage and age. The resulting value is
        based on market data and internal EVehicle product knowledge. Non-EVehicle
        trade-in values are provided based on market data utilizing industry
        standard tools and resources (pending vehicle history verification).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Can I still trade in my vehicle even though I am still in a lease?
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Some vehicles may be eligible for trade in if you are still making
        payments. If your vehicle qualifies, we will calculate and compare the
        payoff amount, early termination penalty (if applicable) and any equity
        (positive or negative) will be added to your Motor Vehicle Purchase
        Agreement. You will not need to pay off the lease or loan in full prior to
        trading in that vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Can I apply the value of my trade-in vehicle to the total purchase of
            my EVehicle vehicle?
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Yes. You can apply any applicable positive equity towards the purchase of
        your new or used EVehicle vehicle. If you have negative equity, it may be
        possible to roll some of this into your EVehicle vehicle purchase.
    </p>

        <a name="delivery"></a>
        <strong>Taking Delivery</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>What information do you need from me before delivery?</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        See EVehicle Delivery Day to learn about the steps required before taking
        delivery. Please note the delivery process can vary based on state of
        residence, financing method and availability.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Do I need to have my insurance policy active for my EVehicle vehicle
            before delivery?
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Some states and/or financing methods require that your insurance for your
        EVehicle vehicle be active by delivery. Your EVehicle representative will
        let you know if this is required.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How do I install charging for my EVehicle vehicle at home?</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        There are a variety of ways to charge your EVehicle vehicle. We recommend
        installing a EVehicle Wall Connector. See home charging installation for a
        step by step process on installing a Wall Connector for your home.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Can I export my EVehicle vehicle outside the US, Canada or Europe?
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        If you export your EVehicle vehicle outside of the market for which it was
        built, we will be unable to service your vehicle until it has been brought
        back to its home market. There is also a possibility that an exported
        EVehicle vehicle will not be compatible with the electrical and charging
        infrastructure in countries for which it was not designed and homologated.
        For these reasons, we strongly recommend that you purchase a EVehicle
        vehicle in the market where you plan to drive it. EVehicle vehicles are
        currently sold and serviced in the US, Canada, Mexico, Europe and Asia
        Pacific.

    <p>
        <a name="accepted-payment"></a>
        <strong>What are the accepted methods of payment?</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Your balance must be paid in full before you will be able to drive off with
        your new EVehicle vehicle. Confirm your method of payment with your
        EVehicle representative prior to your Delivery Day.
    </p>
    <p>
        Final payment is currently accepted via:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Electronic check (direct debit) in the EVehicle app
        </li>
        <li>
            Wire transfer
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        · Bank-certified check (your reference number and name must be in the memo
        line)
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong>
        Credit cards are only accepted for the initial order fee.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Can final payment be made from more than one account?</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Final payment can be made from only one account.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a name="registration"></a>
        <strong>Registration</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>When and how will I receive my license plate(s)?</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        The titling and registration process varies by state. In most states,
        temporary license plates are provided at delivery to allow for final
        processing to take place.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Can I register my car with two names, but only take out a loan in one
            name?
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        No. Your registration must match the names on the loan for your vehicle.
        This requirement applies to both EVehicle Financing, Leasing and
        third-party financing. You can directly edit your registration information
        in the EVehicle app.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Can I register my car to a business?</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Yes. You may register your vehicle to your business. Special conditions
        apply when it comes to financing under a business, so please consult with
        your EVehicle representative.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Can I register my car to a trust?</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Yes. You may register your car to a trust if you are paying cash or
        financing with a third-party institution. Registration under a trust is not
        possible with EVehicle Financing or EVehicle Leasing, and certain
        third-party banks and credit unions may have their own restrictions. You
        will be asked to list all trustees in the EVehicle app
    </p>
