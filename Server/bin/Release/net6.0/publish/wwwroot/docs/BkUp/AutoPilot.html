        <strong>Autopilot and Full Self-Driving Capability</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Autopilot is an advanced driver assistance system that enhances safety and
        convenience behind the wheel. When used properly, Autopilot reduces your
        overall workload as a driver. Each new EVehicles vehicle is equipped with
        eight external cameras and powerful vision processing to provide an
        additional layer of safety. All vehicles built for the North American
        market now use our camera-based EVehicles Vision to deliver Autopilot
        features, rather than radar.
    </p>
    <p>
        Autopilot comes standard on every new EVehicles. For owners who took
        delivery of their cars without Autopilot, there are multiple packages
        available for purchase, depending on when your car was built: Autopilot,
        Enhanced Autopilot and Full Self-Driving Capability.
    </p>
    <p>
        Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot and Full Self-Driving Capability are intended
        for use with a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel and
        is prepared to take over at any moment. While these features are designed
        to become more capable over time, the currently enabled features do not
        make the vehicle autonomous.

        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Enhanced Autopilot</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to the functionality and features of Autopilot, Enhanced
        Autopilot also includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Navigate on Autopilot</strong>

    </p>
    <p>
        The currently enabled Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot and Full Self-Driving
        features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle
        autonomous. Full autonomy will be dependent on achieving reliability far in
        excess of human drivers as demonstrated by billions of miles of experience,
        as well as regulatory approval, which may take longer in some
        jurisdictions. As EVehicles’s Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot and Full
        Self-Driving capabilities evolve, your car will be continuously upgraded
        through over-the-air software updates.

        <strong>
            Using Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot and Full Self-Driving Capability
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Before using Autopilot, please read your Owner's Manual for instructions
        and more safety information. While using Autopilot, it is your
        responsibility to stay alert, keep your hands on the steering wheel at all
        times and maintain control of your car. Many of our Autopilot features,
        like Autosteer, Navigate on Autopilot and Summon, are disabled by default.
        To enable them, you must go to the Autopilot Controls menu within the
        Settings tab and turn them on.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before enabling Autopilot, the driver first needs to agree to “keep your
        hands on the steering wheel at all times” and to always “maintain control
        and responsibility for your vehicle.” Subsequently, every time the driver
        engages Autopilot, they are shown a visual reminder to “keep your hands on
        the wheel."
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Traffic-Aware Cruise Control</strong>
        <br />
        To engage Traffic-Aware Cruise Control in Model S and Model X, pull down
        once on the cruise control stalk on the left of the steering column. In
        Model 3 and Model Y, pull down once on the gear selector stalk on the right
        of the steering column.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Autosteer</strong>
        <br />
        To engage Autosteer in Model S and Model X, pull towards you twice on the
        cruise control stalk on the left of the steering column. In Model 3 and
        Model Y, pull down twice on the gear selector stalk on the right of the
        steering column. A grey steering wheel icon will appear on your display,
        next to the speedometer, when the system is available to engage. A blue
        steering wheel icon will appear on your display, next to the speedometer,
        when Autosteer is engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
        When Autosteer is in use, it measures the amount of torque that you apply
        to the steering wheel and, if insufficient torque is applied, an escalating
        series of audible and visual alerts again reminds you to place your hands
        on the wheel. This helps ensure you are attentive and trains good driving
        habits. If you repeatedly ignore these warnings, then you will be locked
        out from using Autopilot for the duration of that trip.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Navigate on Autopilot</strong>
        <br />
        Navigate on Autopilot is designed to get you to your destination more
        efficiently by actively guiding your car from on-ramp to off-ramp,
        including suggesting and making lane changes, navigating highway
        interchanges, and taking exits. It’s designed to make finding and following
        the most efficient path to your destination even easier on the highway when
        Autopilot is in use.
    </p>
    <p>
        To engage this feature, you must first enable Autosteer by going to
        Controls &gt; Autopilot &gt; Autosteer - then enable the Navigate on
        Autopilot feature. Camera calibration will be required and the latest
        version of Navigation maps must be downloaded via Wi-Fi.
    </p>
    <p>
        For each route where Navigate on Autopilot is available, you will have the
        option to activate it by pressing the NAVIGATE ON AUTOPILOT button located
        in your Navigation Turn List. You can also activate Navigate on Autopilot
        automatically any time a destination is entered and Autopilot is engaged by
        adjusting your Navigate on Autopilot settings from Controls &gt; Autopilot
        &gt; Customize Navigate on Autopilot.
    </p>
    <p>
        On Model 3 and Model Y, Navigate on Autopilot can be engaged on most
        highways by moving the gear lever twice downwards, in quick succession.
    </p>
    <p>
        On Model S and Model X built between 2012-2021, Navigate on Autopilot can
        be engaged on most highways by pulling the cruise stalk toward you, twice
        in quick succession.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Auto Lane Change</strong>
        <br />
        To initiate an automated lane change, you must first enable Auto Lane
        Changes through the Autopilot Controls menu within the Settings tab. Then
        when the car is in Autosteer, a driver must engage the turn signal in the
        direction that they would like to move. In some markets depending on local
        regulations, lane change confirmation can be turned off by accessing
        Controls &gt; Autopilot &gt; Customize Navigate on Autopilot and toggle
        ‘Lane Change Confirmation’ off.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Autopark</strong>
        <br />
        If your car sees a parking spot, a grey 'P' icon will appear on the left or
        right hand side of your instrument panel, depending on the location of the
        space. Autopark detects parallel parking locations when driving below 15mph
        and perpendicular parking locations when driving below 10mph.
    </p>
    <p>
        To use Autopark at that time, press on the brake and shift the gear
        selector into ‘Reverse.' Keep your foot on the brake. ‘Start Autopark’ will
        appear in blue text on your touchscreen – press this to start the feature
        and release the brake and steering wheel. Autopark will then begin to
        maneuver the vehicle into the parking space by controlling your cars speed,
        gear changes and steering angle, but you should remember to be alert and
        monitor the backup camera view to check for obstacles.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once Autopark is complete, the car will let you know it is complete and
        shift into ‘Park.' You can override Autopark at any time by taking control
        of the steering wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Summon</strong>
        <br />
        To use Summon, open the EVehicles app. Press Summon and then press the
        forward or reverse buttons. Model S and Model X owners can use Summon with
        their key fob by holding the center of the key fob for three seconds until
        the car’s hazard lights come on, and then pressing either the frunk or
        trunk button on key fob to Summon forwards and backwards respectively.
        Summon also integrates with HomeLink and will open your garage door to pull
        your car out of the garage.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Smart Summon</strong>
        <br />
        Smart Summon is designed to allow your car to drive to you or a location of
        your choosing, maneuvering around and stopping for objects as necessary.
        Like Summon, Smart Summon is only intended for use in private parking lots
        and driveways. You are still responsible for your car and must monitor it
        and its surroundings at all times and be within your line of sight because
        it may not detect all obstacles. Be especially careful around quick moving
        people, bicycles and cars.
    </p>
    <p>
        To use Smart Summon, open your EVehicles app, tap Summon and then select
        the Smart Summon icon. To activate the feature, press and hold the COME TO
        ME button. Alternatively, tap the target icon, set the target destination
        of your choice by adjusting the map, and then press and hold the GO TO
        TARGET button. You can stop your car from driving at any time by releasing
        the button.
    </p>
    <p>
        Smart Summon works with your EVehicles app and your phone’s GPS to operate.
        You must be within approximately 200 feet of your car to use. Smart Summon
        requires the latest version of the EVehicles mobile app (3.10.0 or later).
        Please refer to the Owner’s Manual for additional details about this
        feature.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control (Beta)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control (Beta) identifies stop signs and
        traffic lights and automatically slows your car to a stop upon approach
        while using Autopilot, with your active supervision. To enable, shift your
        car into PARK and tap Controls &gt; Autopilot &gt; Traffic Light and Stop
        Sign Control (Beta), then engage Traffic-Aware Cruise Control or Autosteer.
    </p>
    <p>
        When Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control (Beta) is enabled, the driving
        visualization displays upcoming traffic lights, stop signs or road markings
        at intersections where your car may need to stop. As you approach an
        intersection, even if the traffic light is green, your car will display a
        red line to indicate where the vehicle will stop and the vehicle will begin
        to slow. To continue through the stop line, pull the Autopilot stalk or
        briefly tap the accelerator pedal to confirm that it is safe to proceed. At
        this time, Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control does not turn the vehicle,
        whether you are in a turn lane or have your blinker on.
    </p>
    <p>
        Notifications on the touchscreen will provide a stop reason (stop sign or
        traffic light) and will also provide an estimated distance to when your
        vehicle will stop. If the Traffic Light notification does not indicate a
        light color, your vehicle has not confirmed the traffic control state.
    </p>
    <p>
        As with all Autopilot features, you must be in control of your vehicle, pay
        attention to its surroundings and be ready to take immediate action
        including braking. This feature is in Beta and may not stop for all traffic
        controls. While Traffic and Stop Sign Control is enabled on surface streets
        with Autosteer active, your speed will be confined to the noted limit.
        Please review the Owner’s Manual for additional information, instructions
        for use and warnings.

        <strong>Active Safety Features</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Active safety features come standard on all EVehicles vehicles made after
        September 2014 for elevated protection at all times. These features are
        made possible by our Autopilot hardware and software system and include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Automatic Emergency Braking</strong>
            : Detects cars or obstacles that the car may impact and applies the
            brakes accordingly
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Forward Collision Warning</strong>
            : Warns of impending collisions with slower moving or stationary cars
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Side Collision Warning</strong>
            : Warns of potential collisions with obstacles alongside the car
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Obstacle Aware Acceleration</strong>
            : Automatically reduces acceleration when an obstacle is detected in
            front of your car while driving at low speeds
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Blind Spot Monitoring</strong>
            : Warns when a car or obstacle is detected when changing lanes
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Lane Departure Avoidance</strong>
            : Applies corrective steering to keep your car in the intended lane
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance</strong>
            : Steers your car back into the driving lane when it detects that your
            car is departing its lane and there could be a collision
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Active safety features are designed to assist drivers, but cannot respond
        in every situation. It is your responsibility to stay alert, drive safely
        and be in control of your car at all times.

        <strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Do all cars have Autopilot?</strong>
        <br />
        No. Autopilot is only available on cars built after September 2014, and
        functionality has changed over time based on the addition of new hardware
        and more powerful processing. For vehicles without Autopilot software, but
        are equipped with the necessary hardware, you can purchase Autopilot,
        Enhanced Autopilot or Full Self-Driving Capability at any time through the
        EVehicles app – and the Autopilot software required will be added to your
        car.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Can I try Autopilot before purchasing?</strong>
        <br />
        You can experience Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot or Full Self-Driving
        Capability on a test drive at one of our EVehicles store locations.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How do I purchase an Autopilot upgrade?</strong>
        <br />
        You can purchase Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot or Full Self-Driving
        Capability at any time through the EVehicles app – and the Autopilot
        software required will be added to your car.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Can a car be retrofitted with Autopilot hardware?</strong>
        <br />
        Cars built between September 2014 and October 2016 include first generation
        Autopilot hardware: one camera, a first-generation radar and ultrasonic
        sensors.
    </p>
    <p>
        These vehicles are ineligible for retrofits to the latest Autopilot
        hardware.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How do I check what Autopilot hardware I have?</strong>
        <br />
        Check your configuration from your touchscreen. Select ‘Controls’ &gt;
        ‘Software’ and confirm Autopilot computer type. Then press ‘Additional
        Vehicle Information.’
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How does Autopilot work?</strong>
        <br />
        As of mid-February 2022, all vehicles built for the North American market
        will feature EVehicles Vision, which uses eight cameras and powerful neural
        net processing to see the environment around the car and deliver Autopilot
        features. This camera suite provides occupants with an awareness of their
        surroundings that a driver alone would not otherwise have. A powerful
        onboard computer processes these inputs in a matter of milliseconds to help
        make driving safer and less stressful.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Do I still need to pay attention while using Autopilot?</strong>
        <br />
        Yes. Autopilot is a hands-on driver assistance system that is intended to
        be used only with a fully attentive driver. It does not turn a EVehicles
        into a self-driving car nor does it make a car autonomous.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before enabling Autopilot, you must agree to “keep your hands on the
        steering wheel at all times” and to always “maintain control and
        responsibility for your car.” Once engaged, Autopilot will also deliver an
        escalating series of visual and audio warnings, reminding you to place your
        hands on the wheel if insufficient torque is applied. If you repeatedly
        ignore these warnings, you will be locked out from using Autopilot during
        that trip.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can override any of Autopilot’s features at any time by steering,
        applying the brakes, or using the cruise control stalk to deactivate.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>What are the limitations of Autopilot?</strong>
        <br />
        Many factors can impact the performance of Autopilot, causing the system to
        be unable to function as intended. These include, but are not limited to:
        poor visibility (due to heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.), bright light (due to
        oncoming headlights, direct sunlight, etc.), mud, ice, snow, interference
        or obstruction by objects mounted onto the vehicle (such as a bike rack),
        obstruction caused by applying excessive paint or adhesive products (such
        as wraps, stickers, rubber coating, etc.) onto the vehicle; narrow, high
        curvature or winding roads, a damaged or misaligned bumper and extremely
        hot or cold temperatures.

        To ensure the Autopilot hardware can provide information that is as
        accurate as possible, keep the cameras and sensors clean and free of
        obstructions or damage. Occasionally remove any buildup of dirt by wiping
        the cameras and sensors with a soft cloth dampened with warm water.

        <strong>How do I use Autopilot features?</strong>
        <br />
        Before using Autopilot, please read your Owner's Manual for instructions
        and more safety information. While using Autopilot features, it is your
        responsibility to stay alert, drive safely and be in control of your car at
        all times.

        <strong>
            How long does Autopilot take to calibrate before you can enable it?
        </strong>
        <br />
        Before Autopilot features can be used for the first time, cameras must
        complete a self-calibration process. Calibration typically completes after
        driving 20-25 miles, but the distance varies depending on road and
        environmental conditions. Contact EVehicles if your car has not completed
        the calibration process after driving 100 miles.

        <strong>Is there blind spot detection?</strong>
        <br />
        To improve safety and increase confidence when changing lanes, cars built
        since October 2016 will display a red lane line when your turn signal is
        engaged and a car or obstacle is detected in your target lane. This
        includes improved blind spot monitoring on the instrument panel which
        reflects the type of car in your blind spot, supplementing an already
        attentive driver.
