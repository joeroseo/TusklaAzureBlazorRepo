    <p>
        <strong>When should I use a Supercharger?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Superchargers are ideal for long distance travel and are designed to charge
        your EVehicles quickly so you can get back on the road. For daily commutes
        or local driving needs, there are a variety of home charging options.

    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong>
        Roadsters do not currently have Supercharging capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How do I charge my vehicle with a Supercharger?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Plug the charging connector into your vehicle charge port. Once
        successfully plugged in, the charge port LED will flash green to indicate
        that charging has begun.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can monitor your charging progress in your EVehicles app. Your payment
        will be processed directly from the payment method in your EVehicles
        Account.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Should I charge to 100%?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Your vehicle will recommend the needed charge level to get to the next
        Supercharger on your route. To reduce congestion at high-use Superchargers,
        your vehicle’s charge limit may be automatically adjusted to 80%. You can
        manually increase the charge limit after plugging in by using the vehicle
        touchscreen or EVehicles app.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a name="locations"></a>
        <strong>Locating a Supercharger</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How can I locate available Supercharger sites?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The interactive Trip Planner in your vehicle can help you locate a
        Supercharger site while you're on the road. To enable Trip Planner, touch
        'Settings' &gt; 'Navigation' &gt; 'Trip Planner' on your touchscreen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you have selected a site, your vehicle’s navigation will automatically
        route you to the nearest entrance of the property. You can then zoom in on
        the map to find the exact location of the station. Tap on the station’s red
        lightning bolt icon on your touchscreen if additional information is
        needed.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Are Superchargers always open?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Almost all Supercharger stations are open for charging 24 hours a day,
        although nearby amenities are subject to business hours.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a Supercharger station does have limited hours, this will be displayed
        on the touchscreen when the site is selected.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Where exactly is the Supercharger station on the property?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Supercharger stations are GPS located in the touchscreen navigation. Your
        vehicle's navigation will route to the nearest entrance and you can zoom in
        on the map to find the exact location of the station. If additional
        instructions are needed, they can be displayed when you tap on the
        station’s red pin. Additional instructions may include a gate code, details
        on the parking level, peak hours and more.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a name="payment"></a>
        <strong>Payments and Fees</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How much is Supercharging?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Specific pricing for each Supercharger site is shown on the selected pin’s
        pop-up on your touchscreen. When your charging session is complete, an
        estimate of the final charges is shown on the screen. Final invoices are
        available in your EVehicles Account, in the ‘Charging’ section.
    </p>
    <p>
        Prices may change from time to time. All prices include taxes and fees.
    </p>
    <p>
        Charging rate is determined by the plug-in time and does not adjust if
        pricing changes during the charging session. Certain Supercharger stations
        offer on-peak and off-peak rates. The rates and peak times are both
        displayed in the navigation application on the touchscreen.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How does pricing work?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Whenever possible, owners are billed per kWh (kilowatt-hour); in other
        areas, owners are billed per minute.
    </p>
    <p>
        When billing per minute, there are four tiers to account for changes in
        charging speeds: ‘Tier 1,’ ‘Tier 2,’ ‘Tier 3’ and ‘Tier 4.’

        <strong>How does payment work?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Payment is automatically processed from the payment method in your
        EVehicles Account.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>What payment methods are currently supported?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The following payment methods are supported:

        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Can I change or remove my payment method?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        You can add, update and remove Supercharging payment methods from your
        EVehicles Account. However, there always needs to be a primary payment
        method on file in your EVehicles Account to successfully purchase
        Supercharging.
    </p>
    <p>
        To add, update or remove a payment method:
    </p>
    <p>
        1. Sign in to your EVehicles Account.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Select 'Add Card.'
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Add or remove your payment information as needed.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. Save your changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        5. You can also go to the 'Charging' page and select 'Manage Payment.'
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How do I know if I have an unpaid balance?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Sign in to your EVehicles Account. If you have an unpaid balance, you will
        see a reminder that your Supercharging balance is due. Select 'Pay Now.'
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>What are idle fees?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Supercharger idle fees are a fleet-wide initiative to ensure a
        frustration-free charging experience for all EVehicles drivers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Superchargers are designed for fast charging and therefore, should only be
        used for as long as it takes to charge a vehicle. If a vehicle parks at a
        Supercharger past a full charge being reached, idle fees start being
        charged. If the vehicle is moved within five minutes of the vehicle
        reaching a full charge, the idle fee is waived.

        <a name="free-supercharging"></a>
        <strong>Free Supercharging</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            How can I check if I have free Supercharging miles available?
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you participated in a previous Referral Program through EVehicles, you
        may have free Supercharging miles. You can see available free Supercharging
        miles and their expiration date in the EVehicles app.
    </p>
    <p>
        To check if you have free, unlimited Supercharging:
    </p>
    <p>
        1. Sign in to your EVehicles Account.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Next to the vehicle linked to your account, select 'Manage' &gt; 'View
        Details.'
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Car Details will show your Supercharging status: Free Unlimited,
        Pay-Per-Use or Timebound Supercharging.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>What happens when I run out of free Supercharging?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Standard Supercharger fees apply after free Supercharging miles are used.
    </p>

        <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            I am not Supercharging as quickly as I expected. What could be
            happening?
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Your vehicle and Superchargers communicate to select the appropriate
        charging rate for your vehicle. Supercharging rates may vary due to battery
        charge level, current use of the Supercharger station and extreme climate
        conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your vehicle charges faster when the battery is at a lower state of charge;
        charging slows down as the battery fills up. Depending on your destination,
        fully charging your battery is often not necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            What do I do if I'm experiencing a problem while using a Supercharger?
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Superchargers are monitored closely and regularly serviced by our EVehicles
        Service Technicians to address any technical issues as quickly as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are experiencing problems with your charging cable, our do it
        yourself guides can provide insight on how to fix this quickly.
