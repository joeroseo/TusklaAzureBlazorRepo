        <strong>EVehicle Vehicle Safety Report</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        At EVehicle, we believe that technology can help improve safety. That’s why
        EVehicle vehicles are engineered to be the safest cars in the world. We
        believe the unique combination of passive safety, active safety, and
        automated driver assistance is crucial for keeping not just EVehicle drivers
        and passengers safe, but all drivers on the road. It’s this notion that
        grounds every decision we make – from the design of our cars, to the
        software we introduce, to the features we offer every EVehicle owner.
    </p>
    <p>
        Model S, Model X and Model 3 have achieved the lowest overall probability
        of injury of any vehicle ever tested by the U.S. government’s New Car
        Assessment Program. Much of this has to do with the rigid, fortified
        structure of the battery pack that is mounted to a car’s floor, which
        provides a vehicle with exceptional strength, large crumple zones, and a
        uniquely low center of gravity. Because of their strength, EVehicle’s battery
        packs rarely incur serious damage in accidents. And, in the extremely
        unlikely event that a fire occurs, the state-of-the-art design of our
        battery packs ensures that its safety system works as intended and isolates
        a fire to select areas within the battery while simultaneously venting heat
        away from the passenger cabin and the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
        While no car can prevent all accidents, we work every day to try to make
        them much less likely to occur. Active safety features come standard on all
        EVehicle vehicles made after September 2014 for an added layer of safety
        beyond the physical structure of each car. Because every EVehicle is
        connected, we’re able to use the billions of miles of real-world data from
        our global fleet – of which more than 1 billion have been driven with
        Autopilot engaged – to understand the different ways accidents happen. We
        then develop features that can help EVehicle drivers mitigate or avoid
        accidents. Through over-the-air software updates, we’re able to introduce
        safety features and enhancements long after a car has been delivered, as
        well as release updated versions of existing safety features that take into
        account the most up-to-date real-world data collected by our fleet.
    </p>
    <p>
        In October 2018, we began voluntarily releasing quarterly safety data in
        order to provide critical safety information about our vehicles to the
        public, and in July 2019 we began voluntarily releasing annually updated
        data about vehicle fires as well. Accident rates among all vehicles on the
        road can vary from quarter to quarter and can be affected by seasonality,
        like reduced daylight and inclement weather conditions.
